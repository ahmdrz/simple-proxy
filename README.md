# simple-proxy
Personal proxy server written in Ruby

## What is it ?
This is my first program in Ruby language , I just want to make a http proxy server for something like MITM !

## How to run ?

```bash
ruby main.rb <port> <logfile>
```

Or you can use it more easier (default port 8008 and without any log file.)

```bash
ruby main.rb
```
